# tupele is seprated by commas and enclosed in round bracket

# tup = (1, 4, 7)
# print(tup)
# print(type(tup))

# # tuple if it has only one value
# t = (10,)
# print(t)
# print(type(t))


# # positive indexing tuple

# # print(tupp[0])
# # print(tupp[1])
# # print(tupp[2])
# # print(tupp[3])

# # Negative indexing
# print(len(tupp)) # 4 - 1 = 3
# print(tupp[-1])
# print(tupp[len(tupp) -1])


# # to find perticular value in tupple
