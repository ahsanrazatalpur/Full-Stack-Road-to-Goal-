// Introduction to MongoDb

// MongoDb is document based Database
// firstly install mongoDb with compass 

// Database : we have frontened and backend but our data is stored in Database 
// or Database is collection of information

// open MongoDb compass here we see new connection (make also favourite because we use multiple Db here)
// we can connect mongoDb through compass as well as code 
// here we have default mongoDb default port now tap connect , now we are connect to installed mongoDb instance in 
// our computer
// MongoDb install mean we create database in MongoDb instance (it may local , host or multiple instance)
// when we connect our Db we see default Db now we can create our own Db eg"Learning" and also give collection name
// eg  as "Database"
// inside collection there is documentation click on it now create or add your own data 
// // EX: "name" : "java",
//        "price" : 20000,
//        "learner" : "Ahsan"
// now click on insert 
// now we persist our data(mean store permanantlty)
// here we have mongoDb shell as terminal help to interact mongoDb called Mogosh 
// type  "show databases" this command show all the db
// type use any db name ex: "Database"
// now we enter in Db 
// now type db.Databases.find() (it will show all the document in the Database)
// type db.Database.insertOne({name : "JS"})  name will be renamed 

// we can  use mongoDb from vs code too 
// install extension named "mongoDb for VS code"
//now see left bootom the MongoDb logo will be seen tap on that  there we see many option same as mongoDb 
// we will prefer to type Add connection ("we can also use mongoDB over  a cloud") but we tap open form 
// there local host was auto created create document 
// now if we create or edit any Db is also apear on MongoDb also
